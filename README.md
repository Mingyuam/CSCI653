# Potential Energy Surface Calculation with Active Learning 



## Problem Description

Using machine learning method to calculate interatomic potentials often requires thousands of first principles calculations. With active learning algorithm, the internal uncertainty of a Gaussian process regression model is used to decide whether to perform a first principle calculation, or just accept the model prediction. This method significantly accelerate the training process. This project aims to apply the active learning package in Ref. [1,2] and start from reproducing the results in the papers to get some insight on active learning approaches. 



## Expected Results

- calculate PES of aluminum with FLARE and Quantum Espresso  
- calculate PES of Mg-Al alloys with DeePMD
