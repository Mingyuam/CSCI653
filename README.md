# Potential Energy Surface Calculation with Active Learning 



## Problem Description

Using machine learning method to calculate interatomic potentials often requires thousands of first principles calculations. With active learning algorithm, the internal uncertainty of a Gaussian process regression model is used to decide whether to perform a first principle calculation, or just accept the model prediction. This method significantly accelerate the training process. This project aims to apply the active learning package in Ref. [1,2] and start from reproducing the results in the papers to get some insight on active learning approaches. 

## DeePMD Kit
### About DeePMD
DeePMD-kit is a package written in Python/C++, designed to minimize the effort required to build deep learning based model of interatomic potential energy and force field and to perform molecular dynamics (MD). This brings new hopes to addressing the accuracy-versus-efficiency dilemma in molecular simulations. Applications of DeePMD-kit span from finite molecules to extended systems and from metallic systems to chemically bonded systems.
### DeePMD Workflow
  - Prepare data (box, coord, energy, force)
  - Train a model
  - Freeze the model
  - MD runs with the model (Native MD code or LAMMPS)  
  

## Water Molecule PES by DeePMD

As a warm up, we applied active learning method to calculate PES of water molecule as function of O-H bond length and bond angle. We will update the details of training process later. 
  
Here we show the PES of water molecule by DeepMD.

## Expected Results

- calculate PES of aluminum with FLARE and Quantum Espresso  
- calculate PES of Mg-Al alloys with DeePMD
