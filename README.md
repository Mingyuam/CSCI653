# Handwritten Table OCR(Optical Character Recognition)



## Problem Description


Converting handwritten text into typed text with good efficiency and accuracy is a popular implemetation of machine learning methods. This project attempts to further recognize a handwritten table automatically into fomartted excel file [1]. Besides the basic task of recognizing charaters and digits, it also requires the program to collect the location information of the text and distinguish between characters and the table lines.



## Methods




Convolutional Neural Network 



## Expected Results




Given a supported format of input picture, generate an excel file with all content properly lying in position.
