# Potential Energy Surface Calculation with Active Learning 



## Problem Description

Using machine learning method to calculate interatomic potentials often requires thousands of first principles calculations. With active learning algorithm, the internal uncertainty of a Gaussian process regression model is used to decide whether to perform a first principle calculation, or just accept the model prediction. This method significantly accelerate the training process. This project aims to apply the active learning package in Ref.[1], to gain some experience on active learning approach.
